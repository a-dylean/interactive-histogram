Interactive histogram component made Next.js and Chart.js. 
Histogram has custom axes and displays data depending on selected period in the dropdown menu.

## How to run locally

To mock up APIs and generate custom data I used [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#getting-started). It is added as a dependency, so to start the server simply run:

```bash
npm run mockapi
```

To run the development server use this command in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
